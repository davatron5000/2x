# 2x

A chrome extension for speedier HTML5 Media

---

Ever wanted a way to play your HTML5 audio podcasts or HTML5 videos at maximum speeds? Well, this is for you. 2x allows you to speed up or slow down your media to *literally* ever speed known to mankind with just a click of a button. Look at all these speeds!

- 0.5x
- 1x
- 1.5x
- 2x
- 2.5x
- 3x

## Installation

You have to install 2x yourself.

- Download the .zip file put it anywhere you like
- Under `Hamburger > Tools > Extensions` in Chrome, check `Developer Mode`. 
- Then click `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you just downloaded.

After that you should be ready to go. Audio nirvana.

**Note:** 2x will install a bunch of viruses and occasionally crash your computer and reformat your harddrive. By downloading it you accept these terms. But it's a pretty cool extension otherwise, I've been using it for the past year or so in **STEALTH MODE**, so it works pretty okay. It's how I get so much done.
